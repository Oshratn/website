# Moving the needle on inclusive language, with Mark Miller of Lawrence Livermore National Lab.

Welcome back to our series **Moving the Needle on inclusive language**. In this series, we talk to leaders in the cloud native space as they share the inclusive naming
initiatives they care about. This will include tools, activities, and results they have discovered along the way.

[Mark Miller](https://www.linkedin.com/in/mark-miller-8a1742163/) works at the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory. He contributes to the development of visualization
tools  used to analyze data from very large simulations. Mark is the first member of a national lab that is involved in the Inclusive Naming Initiative while many other contributors 
come from commercial companies and academia.

**As a white male engineer, what got you interested in inclusive language? What triggered your involvement?**
I lack real life events in which non-inclusive language has presented a barrier to me, as I am at the top of the privilege spectrum. That being said, November 9th 2016 was
a turning point for me (the day Donald Trump became president-elect). When I saw what happened that day, something shifted for me. To that point I had been aware that there
were issues, but I had taken the approach that to be a good person I could just treat everybody the same. That day I decided that this was no way near enough and
that I had to become actively involved. I  had to be a part of moving the needle on issues of racism and other biases like gender or ableism. Sitting on the sidelines and
waiting for others to solve the problem was not the answer. Especially since this leaves the oppressed to deal with things on their own. This problem requires all hands on
deck.

Over the last four years I have spent the majority of the time learning. This morphed into a book club that I am involved in. A small group of us at Livermore Labs decided
to start reading [Me and white supremacy by Layla Saad](https://www.meandwhitesupremacybook.com/) and going through the exercises in it. Every chapter introduces a concept
and asks several questions. In the club we ask ourselves these questions and then answer them. The reason I joined is that White Supremacy was in the title and I think we
need to name what is really happening.

The term white supremacy brings to mind very extreme and violent manifestations. These still happen and cannot be tolerated. That being said, the biggest problem is talking
about and addressing how much white supremacy permeates our culture. A problem that affects both the oppressors and the oppressed. 

Reading the book and doing the exercises have helped me acknowledge these problems. I have also gotten more comfortable talking about them. Something useful that has come
out of it is my ability to recognize and name things that are fundamental to the problem like Tokenization or White Saviorism.

**Do you think inclusive naming initiatives should happen top-down or bottom-up?**
My sense is grassroots, bottom-up is the way to do it. The book club started as and still is dominated by white male faces. Lately, we have been seeing different people
join. My thought is - what we want to do is great, but we can’t act without the authority of the groups that are affected by this language. We would like to see members of
these groups giving us a stamp of approval in some way. This could be either by direct interaction or it can also take the form of providing consultation, guidance or
recommendations. We need to find some way to have them involved in the process. Otherwise, it’s more of the same. People who don’t experience the problems
are trying to make arguments for language they assume is harmful and the inclusive replacements they came up with. Whereas, the community that is affected would be able to
clearly state what is in fact an issue and what is not.

**What steps have you taken to eliminate bias from the language you use at Livermore Labs? What will keep the initiative moving forward?**
Apart from the book club, we are focusing on language in software projects. The most egregious example in the tech community that you may often hear used is Master-Slave.
It has been used for decades and the discourse about it started as early as the 90s.

I have actually written code that used that terminology. I have worked with code that used that terminology. I have probably written related documentation that uses that
terminology. All the while, it never dawned on me that this is problematic language.

Over the last 18 months or so, developers in two of our flagship simulation projects have taken it upon themselves to rid our codebase of that language. I interviewed
people on both those code teams and learned about that process. Many of the managers of these projects have wanted to see this language change for years. The problem
was that they were lacking the credibility with the code teams to make that change. The public discourse in the last year and a half around the George Floyd murder and the
Black Lives Matter movement created an environment in which it was easy to get buy-in for this initiative.

Once they decided that they were going to do it. It turned out to be more work than they had anticipated because of how much it affects things. Finding replacement
terminology that everybody agreed with was hard. Even harder was finding all the places, all the documentation, and all the derivative places in which this language
needed to be replaced. While it was supported by management, it did not get additional funding. As a result the teams had to
set aside other tasks in order to get this done.

You tend to think it’s just find and replace, but in code it’s more than that. In order to get rid of derivatives of this terminology (for example variable names and
acronyms) there are no automated tools. That code had to be manually reviewed by the developers. In one of the projects this involved approaching a million lines of code
and thousands of source files. Ultimately, this initiative impacted 2,000 source files. In addition, users of the interfaces need to be educated on the replacement terms
applied in the code, so they can continue to use it properly. So, there’s training too.

**How do you account for diversity in your organization?**
The computation department at Livermore Labs has many women in management. Overall, we have maybe 40% women. I think we do well with female gender representation. That
being said, we have a lot of work to do when it comes to racial representation.

In this interview, Mark Miller acknowledged his privilege and shared what he was doing about changing the status quo. Racial equality is foremost on his agenda and he is
working from the bottom up to be part of the change he wants to see.
